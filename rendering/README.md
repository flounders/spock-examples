# rendering

This example shows how to make use of the blaze-html templating library
with Spock. The comments on the app handler should give an idea on how
to render other templating libraries.

## Building

To build it is recommended to use stack right now.

To build:

```
$ stack init
$ stack build
```

To run this example:

```
$ stack exec rendering
```
