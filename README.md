# spock-examples

This is a curated collection of examples that make use of the Spock library. The intention
is to show how to use the Spock library and incorporate others in your programs.

Examples are self contained projects that you can build yourself. As of Spock 0.13 it is
recommended that you use stack to build these.

## Current Examples

* guest-database: This extends the initial Spock tutorial to not only count visitors, but allow visitors to sign a guestbook.
* rendering: This shows how to make use of the blaze-html templating library with Spock. The same functions should work with any other templating library.
